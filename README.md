why install python, rust, nodejs, when you can just use powershell--which is built into windows, right?

anyways uh if you're dropped as a baby like me and actually wants to use this, u just need to update `fieldnums.txt`...

...is what i would say, if i didn't hardcode every single handler besides GetAvatarData to send an encoded packet lol

i make every single proto class manually so i got lazy after that one

i think sdkserver is pretty useful since nobody wants to recompile sdkserver all the time
